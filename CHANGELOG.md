### Latest

### 0.14.1

- [fixed] A build error from incompatible versions of markup5ever due to an
  upstream update (thanks anna-hope)

### 0.14.0

- [changed] Various small refactors (thanks sftse)
- [changed] `Config::rich()` no longer includes decorations around `<em>` etc. - 
  use `Config::rich().do_decorate()` to get the old behaviour.
- [fixed] Remove unnecessary empty lines at the start of lists (thanks russellbanks)
- [added] New CSS support: `::before`/`::after` and `content: "string"`, which is now
  used for simple decorations.  With CSS enabled, this allows for customising
  the display of `<em>foo</em>` without writing a decorator.
- [added] Add support for `<h5>` and `<h6>` (thanks noahbaculi)
- [changed] Link footnotes are now configurable independently of the decorator, and on
  by default for `config::plain()` but can be enabled or disabled with
  `config.link_footnotes(true/false)`.  The footnote references (e.g. `[1]`) are added
  in the main renderer, and the actual footnotes are written in a default implementation
  of `TextDecorator::finalise()` so can be customised.

### 0.13.6

- [fixed] Fixed issue parsing CSS rules with known rules but unknown values,
  which caused parsing to stop instead of just skipping the unkown rule.

### 0.13.5

- [added] CSS support for `:nth-child()` (not yet with the `of foo`).
- [added] Non-standard `display: x-raw-dom` for debugging (with `css_ext`
  feature flag).
- [fixed] An issue which could (apparently rarely) miss out some output depending on wrapping
- [fixed] CSS parsing stopped when it hit an at-rule.
- [added] Add `--show-css` option to `html2text` example for debugging what rules were parsed.
- [added] Add poor-man's inspect mode to `html2term` - `I` to enable/disable, and arrows to navigate
  around the DOM.  Implemented using `:nth-child` and `x-raw-dom`.

### 0.13.4

- [fixed] Fix a debug assertion from a double-counted length increment
  (thanks JadedBlueeyes).

### 0.13.3

- [fixed] Handle some obsolete `bgcolor=...` attributes.
- [added] html2text example has `--show-render` to help debugging render issues.
- [changed] Some error handling and other tidyups (thanks sftse)

### 0.13.2

- [fixed] Fixed errors when building with Rust 1.72.

### 0.13.1

- [added] html2text now has --show-dom
- [fixed] Support background CSS property (for colour)
- [fixed] Some edge cases with CSS styles on whitespace

### 0.13.0

- [added] Support CSS white-space: pre-wrap (and normal, pre).

### 0.13.0-alpha.2

- [changed] Updated html5ever and markup5ever crate versions.  This has meant
  updating the MSRV, which is now set to 1.72.
- [fixed] Add `Config::no_link_wrapping()` (thanks JadeBlueEyes)
- [fixed] Fix panic with empty table inside a list (thanks sftse)
- [changed] Top level convenience functions (`from_read` etc.) now return
  `Result<..>` instead of panicking (thanks sftse)
- [fixed] Fix panic with very large HTML `colspan` (thanks pycui)
- [changed] CSS updates:
  - Separate user agent, author, and user CSS layers
  - Improve the style precedence between layers and implement specificity.

### 0.13.0-alpha.1

- [fixed] Table rows with colours would disappear. (thanks tkapias)

### 0.13.0-alpha.0

- [changed] Replaced LightningCSS with a smaller CSS parser.  There is a chance
  that some CSS edge cases which no longer work; if so this would be a bug.
- [removed] Some previously `pub` items and methods which are either internal
  implementation details or considered redundant have been removed or made
  private (thanks sftse).  Please open an issue for anything removed that was
  being used.

  Of note, `RenderTree::render_plain()` and `RenderTree::render_rich()` have
  been removed.  Replace code like:

  ```rust
  let text = html2text::parse(html)?
      .render_plain(80)?
      .into_string()?;
  ```
  with:
  ```rust
  let text = html2text::config::plain()
      .render_to_string(html2text::parse(html)?)?
  ```
- [changed] Some names moved out of `text_renderer` module, so some `use` statements
  may need updating.
- [changed] Replace some `unwrap()` with improved patterns (thanks sftse).
- [changed] Updated some dependencies

### 0.12.5

- [changed] Updated some dependencies
- [added] The `html2text` example now has `--ignore-css-colour`, which ignores CSS
  colour information but still uses `display: none`, for example.
- [added] The `html2text` example now has `--only-css` option, to not use
  default colours when CSS colours are being used.
- [fixed] Make the dummy `dashmap` depenency optional so it's not included
  unnecessarily when CSS isn't enabled (thanks xmakro)

### 0.12.4

- [changed] Update the previous `max-height: 0` to also look at `height: 0` and require
  `overflow: hidden` as well.
  This helps with a hack some e-mail senders use for e-mail previews.  (thanks tkapias)

### 0.12.3

- [changed] Treat `max-height: 0` as if it's `display: none` when CSS is enabled.
  This helps with a hack some e-mail senders use for e-mail previews.  (thanks tkapias)

### 0.12.2

- [changed] Bump version of lightningcss dependency to fix build failures.

### 0.12.1

- [fixed] Fix a case where Err(TooNarrow) was returned unnecessarily. (thanks sftse)

  `Config::no_table_borders()` (thanks sftse)

- [changed] Updated termion dev-dependency

          With `Config::allow_width_overflow()`, prefer returning output wider
          than requested, instead of returning `Err(TooNarrow)`.
          `Config::min_wrap_width()` sets the minimum text wrap width (default
          3).  The minimum width (before overflow or `TooNarrow`) is now
          handled more cleanly.
- [added] CSS: use color/bgcolor attributes on elements.

### 0.11.0

- [fixed] CSS: rules marked !important were ignored.
- [changed] html\_trace feature now uses the `log` crate.
